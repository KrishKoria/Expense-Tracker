# Expense Tracker App

A Semi-beginner Flutter App with custom themes for both dark and light mode users . You can add and delete all your expenses, however this app does not contain any backend, so the data is stored only in memory.
It also contains a bar chart to visualize your expenses. The App is also responsive and will work in both landscape and portrait mode
Primarily focused on android, but will run on ios, however it may not look correct
